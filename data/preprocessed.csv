digital image similarity for knowledge management james david and michela digital medium centre dublin institute of technology dublin ireland jcarswell smart medium institute department of computer science university college dublin belfield dublin ireland abstract the amount and availability of image data such a digital satellite and aerial photograph is increasing dramatically management of such visual information and associated knowledge is a central concern for organisation that rely on digital imagery we are developing knowledge management technique that employ reasoning a the core methodology in order to provide effective retrieval of experience that center around imagery we need to forward novel similarity metric for directly comparing the image component of experience case based on work in image database retrieval we are building an effective similarity metric for imagery that make comparison based on derived image feature their shape and the spatial relation between them this paper give an overview of the knowledge management context describes our image similarity metric and provides an initial evaluation of the work reference ackerman digital image correlation

information extraction a a basis for portable text classification system ellen riloff university of massachusetts amherst department of computer science abstract natural language processing system have achieved good success with many task but they often require many of effort to build an appropriate knowledge base a a result they are not portable across domain this bottleneck must be addressed before system will be practical for application this dissertation address the bottleneck for a natural language processing task called information extraction a system called autoslog is presented which automatically construct dictionary for information extraction given an appropriate training corpus in the domain of terrorism autoslog created a dictionary using a training corpus and five of effort that achieved of the performance of a dictionary that took approximately to build this dissertation also describes three algorithm that use information extraction to support text classification a more information becomes available intelligent information retrieval will be crucial in order to navigate the information highway efficiently and effectively the approach presented here represents a compromise between technique and natural language processing the text classification algorithm classify text with high accuracy by using an underlying information extraction system to represent linguistic phrase and context experiment in the terrorism domain suggest that increasing the amount of linguistic context can improve performance both autoslog and the text classification algorithm are evaluated in three domain terrorism joint venture and microelectronics an important aspect of this dissertation is that autoslog and the text classification system can be easily ported across

the evaluation of a hierarchical case representation using context guided retrieval ian srinath perera bridgewater building university of salford salford uk department of building economics university of moratua moratua sri lanka abstract this paper present the result of the comparison of the performance of a hierarchical case representation using a context guided retrieval method against that of a simpler flat file representation using standard nearest neighbour retrieval the estimation of the construction cost of light industrial warehouse building is used a the test domain each case comprises approximately feature these are structured into a hierarchical case representation that hold more general contextual feature at it top and specific building element at it leaf a modified nearest neighbour retrieval algorithm is used that is guided by contextual similarity problem are decomposed into and solution recomposed into a final solution the comparative result show that the context

finding from a usability evaluation where the ability to read long and short text on a mobile device in a realistic setting wa assessed are reported in a balanced experiment employing subject two variant of adaptive rsvp were benchmarked against fixed rsvp and traditional text presentation no significant difference were found for reading speed and comprehension for long text but for short text all rsvp format increased reading speed by for long text adaptive rsvp decreased task load compared to fixed rsvp and repeated use of rsvp regardless of type wa also found to decrease task load no

henry street pittsburgh pa department of computer science university of utah salt lake city ut abstract when applying text learning algorithm to complex task it is tedious and expensive to the large amount of training data necessary for good performance this present bootstrapping a an alternative approach to learning from large set of data instead of a large quantity of data this paper advocate using a small amount of seed information and a large of unlabeled data initializes a learner with the seed formation it then iterates applying the learner to calculate label for the unlabeled data and incorporating some of these label into the training input for the learner two case study of this approach are presented bootstrapping for information extraction provides for a dictionary for extracting location from web page when starting with just a few seed location bootstrapping a text classifier from a few keywords per class and a class hierarchy provides accuracy of a level close to

feature construction with inductive logic programming a study of quantitative prediction of biological activity by structural attribute ashwin and oxford university computing laboratory wolfson building park road oxford biomolecular modelling laboratory imperial cancer research fund inn field london abstract recently computer program developed within the field of inductive logic programming ilp have received some attention for their ability to construct restricted logic solution using background knowledge prominent application of such program have been concerned with determining relationship in the area of molecular biology and chemistry typically the task here is to predict the of a compound like toxicity from it chemical structure research in the area show that a ilp program have been restricted to qualitative prediction of activity etc b when appropriate attribute are available ilp program have not been able to better the performance of standard quantitative analysis technique like linear regression however ilp program perform creditably when such attribute are unavailable and c when both are applicable ilp program are usually slower than their propositional counterpart this paper examines the use of ilp program not for obtaining theory complete for the sample but a a method of new attribute these could then be used by method like linear regression thus allowing for quantitative prediction and the ability to use structural information a background knowledge using task a a the utility of ilp program in constructing new feature wa evaluated by examining the prediction of chemical activity using linear regression with and without the aid of ilp learnt logical attribute in three out of the five datasets examined the addition of ilp attribute produced statistically better result p in addition six important structural feature that have escaped the attention of the expert chemist were discovered reference andrea and kalayeh

loose coupling of failure explanation and repair sing learning goal to sequence learning method michael cox computer science department carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa mcox abstract because learning method knowledge repair can negatively interact the arbitrary ordering of knowledge repair can lead to worse system performance than no learning at all therefore the problem of choosing appropriate learning method given a performance failure is a significant problem for learning system traditional reasoner index learning or repair method by specific failure characteristic so that once a failure is detected a learning method can be brought to bear such tight coupling can be contrasted to a loose coupling in which the interaction between failure explanation and learning is mediated by the presence of learning goal generated by the learner in an empirical study the implementation performed significantly better under the guidance of learning goal loose coupling than under a condition in which learning goal were ablated tight coupling the conclusion is that unless repair interaction are known not to exist a loose coupling is necessary for effective learning reference cox introspective multistrategy learning constructing a learning strategy under reasoning failure doctoral dissertation tech no georgia institute of technology college of computing atlanta available at url ftp cox an explicit representation of reasoning failure this volume cox ram a interacting treating learning a a planning task in haton keane manago ed advance in reasoning second european workshop pp berlin hammond j planning viewing planning a a memory task vol of perspective in artificial intelligence san diego ca academic press ka a modifying explanation to understand story in proceeding of eighth annual conference of the cognitive science society pp hillsdale nj lawrence erlbaum associate ka a developing creative hypothesis by adapting explanation doctoral dissertation northwestern university the institute for the learning science evanston il owen indexing and retrieving abstract planning knowledge doctoral dissertation yale university department of computer science new haven owen representing abstract plan failure in proceeding of twelfth annual conference of the cognitive science society pp hillsdale nj lawrence erlbaum associate ram a aqua question that drive the understanding process in schank ka riesbeck ed inside explanation pp hillsdale nj lawrence erlbaum associate ram cox introspective reasoning using for multistrategy learning in michalski tecuci ed machine learning iv a multistrategy approach pp san francisco morgan kaufmann ram leake learning goal and learning goal in ram leake ed learning pp cambridge ma mit book redmond a learning by observing and understanding expert problem solving tech no doctoral dissertation georgia institute of technology college of computing atlanta schank ka riesbeck inside explanation hillsdale nj lawrence erlbaum associate sussman j a computer model of skill acquisition new york american elsevier,1

evaluating the application of cbr in mesh design for simulation problem neil hurley hitachi dublin laboratory trinity college dublin ireland nhurley abstract one of the great difficulty facing a designer of a interface to a numerical simulation engine is acquiring sufficient domain knowledge to cover a significant range of problem to a depth that will make the system useful for real it is difficult to enumerate a priori all the different scenario which may be encountered and to devise rule to cater for each indeed it is true to say that often the tuneable parameter of a numerical algorithm such a the error tolerance in a matrix inversion technique or the mesh density in a finite element analysis are determined on a trial and error basis when the problem is first encountered setting up a therefore requires a lot of experimentation over a range of different problem there is no easy way to avoid this knowledge acquisition task if a robust system to tackle problem is to be created furthermore we must accept that the system at some stage is likely to encounter problem outside it coverage it is therefore worthwhile examining alternative reasoning technique which can be utilised when domain knowledge is lacking a well a way that new knowledge can be incorporated into the a take place towards this end we have examined the application of reasoning cbr to finite element simulation and in particular to the of finite element mesh design in a cbr approach to mesh design wa outlined in the current paper we evaluate that system ass it performance at problem solving discus the lesson learned from it development and what implication these have for cbr in general reference kang haghighi a approach to mesh generation in thermal problem international journal for numerical method in engineering zienkiewicz morgan finite element and approximation wiley son shepherd approach to the automatic generation and control offinite element mesh applied mechanic review vol no zienkiewiez zhu a simple error estimator and adaptive procedure for practical engineering analysis international journal for numerical method in engineering vol hurley a priori selection of mesh density for adaptive finite element analysis using a cbr approach in topic in reasoning lecture note in artificial intelligence springer verlag johnson pitkaranta finite element method for linear hyperbolic problem comp meth appl mech eng vol finn hurley sagawa a environment for numerical simulation of engineering problem described by partial differential equation vol no,1

learning function represented a multiplicity automaton amos beimel y francesco bergadano z nader bshouty x eyal kushilevitz stefano varricchio k april abstract we study the learnability of multiplicity automaton in angluin exact learning model and we investigate it application our starting point is a known theorem from automaton theory relating the number of state in a minimal multiplicity for a function to the rank of it hankel matrix with this theorem in hand we present a new simple algorithm for learning multiplicity automaton with improved time and query complexity and we prove the learnability of various concept class these include among others ffl the class of disjoint dnf and more generally dnf ffl the class of polynomial over finite field ffl the class of polynomial over infinite field ffl the class of xor of term ffl certain class of box in high dimension in addition we obtain the best query complexity for several class known to be by other method such a decision tree and polynomial over gf while multiplicity automaton are shown to be useful to prove the learnability of some subclass of dnf formula and various other class we study the limitation of this method we prove that this method cannot be used to resolve the learnability of some other open problem such a the learnability of general dnf formula or even dnf for k log n or dnf

information retrieval exploration of query translation and transliteration atsushi fujii and tetsuya ishikawa university of library and information science kasuga tsukuba japan fujii computer and the humanity abstract information retrieval clir where query and document are in different ha of late become one of the major topic within the information retrieval community this paper proposes a clir system where we combine a query translation and retrieval module we currently target the retrieval of technical document and therefore the performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation of term however the technical term translation is still problematic in that technical term are often compound word and thus new term are progressively created by combining existing base word in addition japanese often represents loanword based on it special phonogram consequently existing dictionary find it di cult to achieve su cient coverage to counter the first problem we produce a dictionary for base word and translate compound word on a basis we also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation for the second problem we use a transliteration method which corresponds word unlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalent in the target language we evaluate our system using a test collection for clir and show that both the compound word translation and transliteration method improve the system performance reference aaai electronic working note of the aaai spring symposium on text and speech retrieval http acm sigir proceeding of the

system task and adaptation knowledge revealing some revealing dependency kathleen hanney mark barry and padraig department of computer science university of dublin trinity college dublin ireland hitachi dublin laboratory university of dublin trinity college dublin ireland abstract this paper show that the use of adaptation knowledge in cbr system is heavily dependent on certain task and system constraint furthermore the type of adaptation knowledge used in system performing specific task is quite regular and predictable these conclusion are reached by reviewing cbr system and classifying them according to three taxonomy an taxonomy of cbr system a taxonomy of task and a taxonomy of adaptation knowledge we then show how different system cluster with respect to interaction between these three taxonomy the cbr system designer may find the partition of cbr system and the division of adaptation knowledge suggested by this paper useful moreover this paper may help focus the initial stage of system development by suggesting on the basis of existing work what type of adaptation knowledge should be supported by a new system in addition the paper provides a framework for the

an empirical study of automated dictionary construction for information extraction in three domain ellen riloff department of computer science university of utah salt lake city ut a primary goal of natural language processing researcher is to velop a natural language processing nlp system that is portable across domain however most nlp system rely on a dictionary of concept which represents a substantial bottleneck we have developed a system called autoslog that address the bottleneck for a task called information autoslog automatically creates y for information extraction given an appropriate training corpus we have used autoslog to create a dictionary of extraction pattern for terrorism which achieved of the performance of a crafted dictionary that required approximately to build in this paper we describe experiment with autoslog in two additional domain joint venture and microelectronics we compare the performance of autoslog across the three domain discus the lesson learned about the generality of this approach and present result from two experiment which demonstrate that novice user can generate effective dictionary using autoslog reference ayuso boisen fox gish

an approach to aggregating ensemble of lazy learner that support explanation gabriele zenobi and pádraig cunningham department of computer science trinity college dublin abstract ensemble research ha shown that the aggregated output of an ensemble of predictor can be more accurate than a single predictor this is true also for lazy learning system like reasoning cbr and aggregation is normally achieved by voting in classification task and by averaging in regression task for cbr this increased accuracy come at the cost of interpretability however if we consider the use of retrieved case for explanation to be one of the advantage of cbr then this is lost in an ensemble this is because a large number of case will have been retrieved by the ensemble member in this paper we present a new technique for aggregation that obtains excellent result and identifies a small number of case for use in explanation this new approach might be viewed a a transformation process whereby case are transformed from their feature based representation to a representation based on the prediction of ensemble member this new representation produce very accurate prediction and allows a small number of similar neighbour to be identified reference armengol palaudàries plaza individual prognosis of diabetes risk a cbr approach method of information in medicine special issue on prognostic model in medicine vol pp breiman bagging predictor machine learning cunningham carney diversity versus quality in classification ensemble based on feature selection european conference on machine learning ecml lecture note in artificial intelligence lópez de mántaras and plaza ed pp springer verlag cunningham zenobi case representation issue for reasoning from ensemble research in proceeding of international conference on reasoning ed aha watson lnai springer verlag whitley genetic approach for feature selection for ensemble creation in proceeding of the genetic and evolutionary computation conference banzhaf daida eiben garzon honavar jakiela smith e orlando florida usa san francisco ca morgan kaufmann whitley feature selection mechanism for ensemble creation a genetic search perspective in data mining with evolutionary algorithm research direction paper from the aaai workshop alex freitas ed technical report aaai press hansen salamon neural network ensemble ieee pattern analysis and machine intelligence heskes selecting weighting factor in logarithmic opinion pool advance in neural information processing system ho nearest neighbour in random subspace proc of international workshop on statistical technique in pattern recognition amin dori puil freeman ed springer verlag lncs kohavi langley yun the utility of feature weighting in nearestneighbor algorithm european conference on machine learning prague czech republic poster krogh vedelsby neural network ensemble cross validation and active learning in advance in neural information processing system tesauro touretsky leen mit press cambridge ma jacob jordan nowlan hinton adaptive mixture of local expert neural computation leake cbr in context the present and future in leake ed reasoning experience lesson and future direction mit press ong sheperd tong ho tong ho tan the colorectal cancer recurrence support care system artificial intelligence in medicine ricci aha output code for local learner proceeding of the tenth european conference on machine learning chemnitz germany springer van de laar heskes input selection based on an ensemble neurocomputing wettschereck aha mohri a review and empirical evaluation of feature weighting method for a class of lazy learning algorithm artificial intelligence review zenobi cunningham using diversity in preparing ensemble of classifier based on different feature subset to minimize generalization error european conference on machine learning ecml ed de raedt flach lnai springer verlag,1

the implementation and the evaluation of a graphical user interface gui employing the rapid serial visual presentation rsvp technique the gui wa implemented on a personal digital assistant pda featuring a inch colour screen the aim of the user evaluation wa firstly to compare rsvp with reading on paper medium in term of reading speed reading comprehension reading efficiency experienced workload and reader attitude secondly to examine whether sonification adding audio information of the text is a way to height en the reading experience when reading with rsvp the user evaluation wa conducted with ten subject using a design the text usedweresix chaptersof august strindberg roda rummet four different condition were administered book two rsvp format and a sonified rsvp format presented at constant speed the evaluation showed no significant difference in reading speed comprehension or reading efficiency between reading from the book and the rsvp condition a linear between comprehension and reading speed wa found for each increase in reading speed comprehension decreased by the subject rated all six factor in a workload index except physical demand significantly higher

reasoning for cash flow forecasting using fuzzy retrieval rosina weber ricardo miranda and suresh of south florida tampa fl usa university of santa catarina industrial engineering florianópolis sc brazil abstract reasoning cbr simulates the human way of solving problem a it solves a new problem using a successful past experience applied to a similar problem in this paper we describe a cbr system that develops forecast for cash flow account forecasting cash flow to a certain degree of accuracy is an important aspect of a working capital decision support system working capital wc management decision reflect a choice among different option on how to arrange the cash flow the decision establishes an actual event in the cash flow which mean that one need to envision the consequence of such a decision hence forecasting cash flow accurately can minimize loss caused by usually unpredictable event cash flow are usually forecasted by a combination of different technique enhanced by human feeling about the future which are grounded in past experience this make the use of the cbr paradigm the proper choice advantage of a cbr system over other artificial intelligence technique are associated to knowledge acquisition knowledge representation reuse updating and justification an important step in developing a cbr system is the retrieval of similar case the proposed

analogical reasoning in general problem solving manuela veloso school of computer science carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa veloso abstract this paper describes the integration of analogical reasoning into general problem solving a a method of learning at the strategy level to solve problem more effectively the method hased on derivational analogy ha been fully implemented in and proven empirically to he amenable to scaling up hoth in term of domain and problem complexity address a set of challenging problem namely how to accumulate episodic problem solving experience case how to define and decide when two problem solving situation are similar how to organize a large library of planning case so that it may be efficiently retrieved and finally how to successfully transfer chain of problem solving decision from past experience to new problem solving situation when only a partial match exists among corresponding problem the paper discus the generation and replay of the problem solving case and we illustrate the algorithm with example we present briefly the library organization and the retrieval strategy we relate this work with other alternative strategy learning method and also with plan reuse cast the learning process for the first time a the automation of the complete cycle of constructing storing retrieving and flexibly reusing problem solving experience we demonstrate the effectiveness of the analogical replay strategy by providing empirical result on the performance of accumulating and reusing a large case library in a complex problem solving domain the integrated learning system reduces the problem solving search effort incrementally a more episodic experience is compiled into the library of accumulated learned knowledge reference bareiss and

the design of widget stephen brewster glasgow interactive system group department of computing science university of glasgow glasgow uk tel fax email stephen web this paper describes the design of widget that include sound previous research ha shown that the addition of sound can improve the usability of interface however there is little research to show where the best place are to add sound to improve usability the approach described here is to integrate sound into widget the basic component of the interface an overall structure for the integration of sound is presented there are many problem with current graphical widget and many of these are difficult to correct by using more graphic this paper present many of the standard graphical widget and describes how sound can be added it describes in detail the usability problem with the widget and then the sound to overcome them the speech sound used are earcons these widget allow designer who are not to create interface that

robust private information retrieval amos beimel yoav stahl y abstract a private information retrieval pir protocol allows a user to retrieve a data item of it choice from a database such that the server storing the database do not gain information on the identity of the item being retrieved pir protocol were studied in depth since the subject wa introduced in chor goldreich kushilevitz and sudan the standard definition of pir protocol raise a simple question what happens if some of the server crash during the operation how can we devise a protocol which still work in the presence of crashing server current system do not guarantee availability of server at all time for many reason crash of server or communication problem our purpose is to design robust pir protocol protocol which still work correctly even if only k out of server are available during the protocol operation the user doe not know in advance which server are available we present various robust pir protocol giving different tradeoff between the different parameter these protocol are incomparable for different value of n and k we will get better result using protocol we first present a generic transformation from regular pir protocol to robust pir protocol this transformation is important since any improvement in the communicationcomplexity of regular pir protocol will immediately implicate improvement in the robust pir protocol communication we also present two specific robust pir protocol finally we present robust pir protocol which can tolerate byzantine server robust pir protocol which still work

improved learning and generalized statistical query javed aslam scott decatur aiken computation laboratory harvard university cambridge ma july abstract the statistical query learning model can be viewed a a tool for creating or the existence of learning algorithm in the pac model the complexity of a statistical query algorithm in conjunction with the complexity of sq algorithm in the pac model with noise determine the complexity of the pac algorithm produced although roughly optimal upper bound have been shown for the complexity of statistical query learning the corresponding tolerant pac algorithm are not optimal due to ine cient simulation in this paper we provide both improved simulation and a new variant of the statistical query model in order to overcome these ineficiencies we improve the time complexity of the classification noise simulation of statistical query algorithm our new simulation ha a roughly optimal dependence on the noise rate we also derive a simpler proof that statistical query can be simulated in the presence of classification noise this proof make fewer assumption on the query themselves and therefore allows one to simulate more general type of query we also define a new variant of the statistical query model based on relative error and we show that this variant is more natural and strictly more powerful than the standard additive error model we demonstrate e cient pac simulation for algorithm in this new model and give general upper bound on both learning with relative error statistical query and pac simulation we show that any statistical query algorithm can be simulated in the pac model with malicious error in such a way that the resultant pac algorithm ha a roughly optimal tolerable malicious error rate and sample complexity finally we generalize the type of query allowed in the statistical query model we discus the advantage of allowing these generalized query and show that our result on improved simulation also hold for these

refinement operator can be weakly perfect liviu badea and monica stanciu ai lab research institute for informatics averescu bucharest romania badea abstract our aim is to construct a perfect minimal and optimal jlp refinement operator for hypothesis space bounded below by a most specific clause and subject to syntactical restriction in the form of variable declaration like in progol since unfortunately no such optimal refinement operator exist we settle for a weaker form of optimality and introduce an associated weaker form of subsumption which exactly capture a first incompleteness of refinement operator we argue that this sort of incompleteness is not a drawback a it is justified by the example and the mdl heuristic a second type of incompleteness of progol due to subtle interaction between the requirement of completeness and the variable dependency is more problematic since it may sometimes lead to unpredictable result we remove this incompleteness by constructing a sequence of increasingly more complex refinement operator which eventually produce the first weakly perfect refinement operator for a ilp system reference esposito laterza malerba semeraro refinement of datalog program workshop on data mining and ilp bari de raedt bruynooghe a theory of clausal discovery grobelnik induction of prolog program with markus muggleton inverse entailment and progol new generation computing journal van der laag an analysis of refinement operator in ilp phd thesis tinbergen inst re series van der laag existence and nonexistence of complete refinement operator,2

storage the amount of information on the net a well a on a user local computer ha increased dramatically in recent year although this readily available information should be extremely beneficial for computer user paradoxically it is now much harder to find anything many different solution have been proposed to the general information seeking task of user but few if any have addressed the need of individual or have leveraged the benefit of interaction the haystack project is an attempt to answer the need of the individual user creating such a system requires solving two problem half the problem address the manipulation of the data into a queryable format once the user information is represented in haystack the other half of the problem center around our desire to answer the highly varied question a user may ask about this information in this thesis we will propose a mean of representing information in a robust model within haystack and we will describe a corresponding mechanism by which the diverse question of the individual can be answered this novel method function by using a combination of existing information system we will call this combined system a system bibliography

reducing the server computation in private information retrieval pir with preprocessing amos beimel y yuval ishai z tal malkin x june abstract private information retrieval pir enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database replicated among one or more server while hiding the identity of the retrieved item this problem wa suggested by chor goldreich kushilevitz and sudan in and since then efficient protocol with communication were suggested however in all these protocol the server computation for each retrieval is at least linear in the size of entire database even if the user requires only a single bit in this paper we study the computational complexity of pir we show that in the standard pir model where the server hold only the database linear computation cannot be avoided to overcome this problem we propose the model of pir with preprocessing before the execution of the protocol each server may compute and store information bit regarding the database later on this information should enable the server to answer each query of the user with more eæcient computation we demonstrate that preprocessing can significantly save work in particular we construct for any constant k and a protocol with o n communication o log n work and o n storage a protocol with o n communication and work and n o storage a protocol with o n communication o n work and n o storage and a protocol with a polylogarithmic number of server polylogarithmic communication and work and o n storage on the lower bound front we prove that the product of the extra storage used by the server in addition to the length of the database and the expected amount of work is at least linear in finally we suggest two alternative model to saving computation by batching query and by allowing a

specification and simulation of statistical query algorithm for efficiency and noise tolerance javed aslam department of computer science dartmouth college hanover nh scott decatur y laboratory for computer science massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma abstract a recent innovation in computational learning theory is the statistical query sq model the advantage of specifying learning algorithm in this model is that sq algorithm can be simulated in the pac model both in the absence and in the presence of noise however simulation of sq algorithm in the pac model have time and sample complexity in this paper we introduce a new method for specifying statistical query algorithm based on a type of relative error and provide simulation in the and pac model which yield more efficient algorithm request for estimate of statistic in this new model take the form return an estimate of the statistic within a factor or return promising that the statistic is le than in addition to showing that this is a very natural language for specifying learning algorithm we also show that this new specification is polynomially equivalent to standard sq and thus known learnability and hardness result for statistical query learning are preserved we then give highly efficient pac simulation of relative error sq algorithm we show that the learning algorithm obtained by simulating efficient relative error sq algorithm in both the absence of noise and in the presence of malicious noise have roughly optimal sample complexity we also show that the simulation of efficient error sq algorithm in the presence of classification noise yield learning algorithm at least a efficient a those obtained through standard method and in some case roughly optimal result are achieved the sample complexity for all of these simulation are based on the d metric which is a type of relative error metric useful for quantity which are small or even zero we show that uniform convergence with respect to the d metric yield uniform convergence with respect to accuracy finally while we show that many specific learning algorithm can be written a highly efficient relative error sq algorithm we also show in fact that all sq can be written efficiently by proving general upper bound on the complexity of query a a function of the accuracy parameter a a consequence of this result we give general upper bound on the complexity of learning algorithm achieved through the use of relative error sq algorithm and the simulation described above reference dana angluin and leslie valiant fast

noise tolerant algorithm for learning and searching javed alexander aslam electrical engineering and computer science massachusetts institute of technology abstract we consider the problem of developing robust algorithm which cope with noisy data in the probably approximately correct model of machine learning we develop a general technique which allows nearly all pac learning algorithm to be converted into highly efficient pac learning algorithm which tolerate noise in the field of combinatorial algorithm we develop technique for constructing search algorithm which tolerate linearly bounded error and probabilistic error in the field of machine learning we derive general bound on the complexity of learning in the recently introduced statistical query model and in the pac model with noise we do so by considering the problem of improving the accuracy of learning algorithm in particular we study the problem of the accuracy of learning algorithm which fall within the statistical query model and we show that it is possible to improve the accuracy of such learning algorithm to any arbitrary accuracy we derive a number of interesting consequence from this result and in particular we show that nearly all pac learning algorithm can be converted into highly eæcient pac learning algorithm which tolerate classification noise and malicious error we also investigate the longstanding problem of searching in the presence of error we consider the problem of determining an unknown quantity x by asking question where some of the answer may be erroneous we focus on two different model of error the linearly bounded model where for some known constant r each initial sequence of i answer is guaranteed to have no more than ri error and the probabilistic model where error occur randomly and independently with probability p we develop highly efficient algorithm for searching in the presence of linearly bounded error and we further show that searching in the presence of probabilistic error can be eæciently reduced to searching in the presence of linearly bounded error bibliography dana angluin computational learning theory survey and selected bibliography

carcinogenesis prediction using ilp oxford university comp wolfson park rd oxford uk dept of comp university of wale aberystwyth ceredigion uk biomolecular modelling icrf inn field london uk abstract obtaining accurate structural alert for the cause of chemical cancer is a problem of great scientific and humanitarian value this paper follows up on earlier research that demonstrated the use of inductive logic programming ilp for prediction for the related problem of mutagenic activity amongst nitroaromatic molecule here we are concerned with predicting carcinogenic activity in rodent bioassay using data from the national toxicology program conducted by the national institute of environmental health science the chemical used here are significantly more diverse than the previous study and form the basis for obtaining relationship sars relating molecular structure to cancerous activity in rodent we describe the use of the ilp system progol to obtain sars from this data the rule obtained from progol are comparable in accuracy to those from expert chemist and more accurate than most toxicity prediction method the rule can also be interpreted to give clue about the biological and chemical mechanism of carcinogenesis and make use of those learnt by progol for inutagenesis finally we present detail of and prediction for an ongoing international blind trial aimed specifically at comparing prediction method this trial provides ilp algorithm an opportunity to participate at the of scientific discovery reference ashby and tennant definitive relationship among

using tree to improve the retrieval step in reasoning stefan wess althoff and guido derwand university of kaiserslautern kaiserslautern germany wess abstract retrieval of case is one important step within the reasoning paradigm we propose an improvement of this stage in the process model for finding most similar case with an average effort of o n number of case the basic idea of the algorithm is to use the heterogeneity of the search space for a structuring and to employ this precomputed structure a tree for efficient case retrieval according to a given similarity measure besides illustrating the basic idea we present empirical result of a comparison of four different tree generating strategy and introduce the notion of dynamic bound which significantly reduce the retrieval effort the

towards a unified theory of adaptation in reasoning béatrice jean alain and amedeo université lyon iii iae équipe modeme quai claude bernard lyon cedex loria umr bp cedex bd du novembre villeurbanne cedex email fuchs lieber am napoli abstract reasoning exploit memorized problem solving episode called case in order to solve a new problem adaptation is a complex and crucial step of reasoning which is generally studied in the restricted framework of an application domain this article proposes a first analysis of case adaptation independently from a specific application domain it proposes to combine the retrieval and adaptation step in a unique planning process that build an ordered sequence of operation starting from an initial state the stated problem and leading to a final state the problem once solved thus the issue of case adaptation can be addressed by studying the issue of plan adaptation finally it is shown how case retrieval and case adaptation can be related thanks to

adaptation using constraint satisfaction technique lisa and pearl dept of computer science university of connecticut ct laboratoire artificielle robotique institut de microtechnique dmt swiss federal institute of technology epfl lausanne switzerland abstract case adaptation a central component of reasoning is often considered to be the most difficult part of a reasoning system the difficulty arise from the fact that adaptation often doe not converge especially if it is not done in a systematic way this problem sometimes termed the assimilation problem is especially pronounced in the design problem solving domain where a large set of constraint and feature are processed furthermore in the design domain multiple case must be considered in conjunction in order to solve the new problem resulting in the difficulty of how to efficiently combine the case into a global solution for the new problem in order to achieve case combination we investigate a methodology which formalizes the process using constraint satisfaction technique we represent each case a a primitive constraint satisfaction problem csp and apply an existing csp algorithm to combine these primitive csps into a globally consistent solution for the new problem the run time is satisfactory for providing a quick and explicable answer to whether existing case can be adapted or if new case would have to be created we have tested our methodology in the configuration design and assembly sequence generation domain reference bain judge in reisbeck schank editor inside reasoning eribaum publisher bessiere arc consistency in dynamic constraint satisfaction problem in proceeding of the nat conf of aaai anaheim carbonell derivational analogy a theory of reconstructive problem solving and expertise acquisition in machine learning volume carbonell and veloso integrating derivational analogy into a general problem solving architecture in proceeding workshop on case based reasoning darpa clearwater florida morgan kaufmann publisher eric domeshek and janet kolodner finding the point of large case artificial intelligence in engineering design analysis and manufacturing ai edam ewer sincere vacuum cleaner and small appliance repair service manual sincere press faltings haroud and smith dynamic constraint satisfaction with continuous variable in proceeding of the european conf on ai wien gentner structure mapping a theoretical framework for analogy cognitive science hammond chef a model of planning in proceeding of cambridge ma hennessy and hinkle applying reasoning to autoclave loading ieee expert hinrichs problem solving in open world a case study in design northvale publisher kefeng hua and boi faltings exploring building design cadre artificial intelligence in engineering design analysis and manufacturing aiedam kolodner case based reasoning morgan kaufmann publisher koton reasoning about evidence in causal explanation in proceeding of cambridge ma mary lou maher and dong mei zhang cadsyn a design process model artificial intelligence in engineering design analysis and manufacturing aiedam minton johnston philip and laird minimizing conflict a heuristic repair method for constraint satisfaction and scheduling problem artificial intelligence mittal and falkenhainer dynamic constraint satisfaction in proceeding of the national conference of aaai pearl pu issue in design system artificial intelligence in engineering design analysis and manufacturing ai edam page a guest editor for a special issue on design system pearl pu and lisa purvis formalizing case adaptation in a design system in proceeding of the third international conference on artificial intelligence in design aid august pearl pu and markus reschberger assembly planning in proceeding of reasoning workshop morgan kaufmann,1

improving case representation and case base maintenance in recommender agent miquel montaner beatriz lópez and josep lluís de la rosa institut i aplicacions universitat de girona campus montilivi girona spain mmontane blopez pepiluis abstract recommendation by salesperson are always based on knowledge about the product and expertise about your taste preference interest and behavior in the shop in an attempt to model the behavior of salesperson ai research ha been focussed on the so called recommender agent such agent draw on previous result from machine learning and other advance in ai technology to develop user model and to anticipate and predict user preference in this paper we introduce a new approach to recommendation based on reasoning cbr cbr is a paradigm for learning and reasoning through experience a salesman do we present a user model based on case in which we try to capture both explicit interest the user is asked for information and implicit interest captured from user interaction of a user on a given item retrieval is based on a similarity function that is constantly tuned according to the user model moreover in order to cope with the utility problem that

information extraction a a basis for text classification ellen riloff and wendy lehnert department of computer science university of massachusetts amherst ma riloff lehnert abstract we describe an approach to text classification that represents a compromise tween traditional technique and natural language processing our approach us a natural language processing task called information extraction a a basis for text classification we present three algorithm that use varying amount of extracted information to classify text the relevancy signature algorithm us linguistic phrase the augmented relevancy signature algorithm us phrase and local context and the text classification algorithm us larger piece of context relevant phrase and context are acquired automatically using a training corpus we evaluate the algorithm on the basis of two test set from the corpus all three algorithm achieved high precision on both test set with the augmented relevancy signature algorithm and the algorithm reaching precision with over recall on one set in addition we compare the algorithm on a larger collection of text and describe an automated method for empirically deriving appropriate threshold value the result suggest that information extraction technique can support text classification and in general using more extracted information improves performance a a practical matter we

handling quantifier in ilp goncalves université de paris sud laboratoire de recherche en informatique bâtiment orsay cedex france email goncalve abstract an important research area in the field of inductive logic programming ilp is concerned with predicate learning recently many predicate learner have been developed whose task consists in learning a definition of a concept from positive and negative example in most of them the definition of the concept is represented by a set of definite or normal clause the variable that appear in the head of a clause the are universally quantified and the variable that appear only in the body of the clause the are existentially quantified some predicate learner described in the ilp literature are able to deal with such existential variable using some language bias like see however a far a the author know no ilp system is able to deal with clause in whose body both existential and universal appear moreover there exists no generalisation and no specialisation operator that handle such in this paper we first present a set of rule devoted to deal with existential and universal variable that appear only in the body of the clause we then highlight some property of these rule essentially correctness and completeness theorem we do not explicit any type of control that could permit to exploit practically these rule in an ilp system however we give some idea of how to integrate them in different sort of system with minor modification and without increasing the search space too greatly following the motivation of ilp system with respect to more classical machine learning one an important motivation of these rule is to extend the expressiveness of the ilp representation formalism clause without any skolem function with only existential moreover a significant interest of the presented in this paper is that several existing ilp system can be adapted with some modification to process quantifier in the body of clause and thus increase their expressiveness reference ade de raedt and bruynooghe declarative bias for ilp system machine learning volume pp bergadano gunetti nicosia and ruffo learning logic program with negation a failure in de raedt editor proceeding of the international workshop on inductive logic programming pp leuven belgium cain the ductor a theory revision system for propositional domain in proceeding of the international machine learning workshop evanston cox and pietrzykowski a complete nonredundant algorithm for reversed skolemisation in theoretical computer science volume pp ginsberg theory revision via prior operationalisation in proceeding of the national conference on artificial intelligence pp goncalves traitement de quantificateurs en ilp in technical report to appear lapointe and matwin a tool for efficient induction of recursive program in proceeding of the international machine learning conference los alto ca michalski learning from observation conceptual clustering in michaiski carbonell and mitchell editor machine learning an artificial intelligence approach pp muggleton inverse entailment and progol in new generation computing volume pp muggleton and buntine machine invention of predicate by inverting resolution in morgan kaufmann editor proceeding of the international conference on machine learning pp muggleton and feng efficient induction of logic program in proceeding of the workshop on algorithmic learning theory obmeha publisher tokyo muggleton and de raedt inductive logic programming theory and method in journal of logic programming volume pp nedellec how to specialise by theory refinement in neumann editor proceeding of ecai pp wiley nedellec and rouveirol bias for incremental system in the aaai spring symposium on training issue in incremental learning standford university nedellec and rouveirol specification of the haiku system in technical report lri number ourston and mooney changing the rule a comprehensive approach to theory refinement in proceeding of national conference on artificial intelligence pp quinlan and foil a midterm report in pavel brazdil editor machine learning vienna austria springer verlag de raedt interactive theory revision an inductive logic programming approach in academic press limited de raedt and bruynooghe a theory of clausal discovery in proceeding of the ijcai morgan kaufmann rouveirol extension of inversion of resolution applied and theory completion in muggleton editor inductive logic programming pp academic press sammut and banerji learning concept by asking question in michalski carbonnel and mitchell editor machine learning an artfficial intelligence approach volume kaufmann los alto ca pp shapiro algorithmic program debugging mit press wrobel on the proper definition of minimality in specialisation and theory revision in pavel brazdil editor proceeding of the european conference on machine learning pp vienna,2

learning to improve case adaptation by introspective reasoning and cbr david leake andrew kinley and david wilson computer science department lindley hall indiana university bloomington in abstract in current cbr system case adaptation is usually performed by method that use rule by the system developer the ability to define those rule depends on knowledge of the task and domain that may not be available a priori presenting a serious impediment to endowing cbr system with the needed adaptation knowledge this paper describes ongoing research on a method to address this problem by acquiring adaptation knowledge from experience the method us reasoning from scratch based on introspective reasoning about the requirement for successful adaptation to build up a library of adaptation case that

a note on two simple transformation for improving the efficiency of an ilp system vitor santos ashwin and rui ufrj brazil and liacc universidade do porto portugal oxford university comp wolfson park rd oxford uk liacc and feup universidade do porto portugal abstract inductive logic programming jlp system have had noteworthy success in extracting comprehensible and accurate model for data drawn from a number of scientific and engineering domain these result suggest that ilp method could enhance the capability of software tool being developed for the emerging discipline of discovery from one significant concern in the use of jlp for this purpose is that of efficiency the performance of modern ilp system is principally affected by two issue they often have to search through very large number of possible rule usually in the form of definite clause they have to score each rule on the data usually in the form of ground fact to estimate stochastic and greedy approach have been proposed to alleviate the complexity arising from each of these issue while these technique can result in improvement in the search complexity of an ilp system they do so at the expense of exactness a this may be unacceptable in some situation we examine two method that result in admissible transformation of clause examined in a search while the method do not alter the size of the search space that is the number of clause examined they can alleviate the effort required to estimate goodness the first transformation simply involves eliminating literal using a weak test for redundancy the second involves partitioning the set of literal within a clause into group that can be executed independently of each other the efficacy of these transformation are evaluated empirically on a number of llp datasets the result suggest that for problem that require the use of highly predicate the transformation can provide significant gain a the complexity of clause sought increase reference benigni q sar

learning in logic programming and constraint logic programming michèle and céline lm ura cnrs lri ura cnrs ecole polytechnique université paris sud palaiseau cedex orsay cedex abstract induction in logic language suffers from an additional factor of complexity compared to induction in language the number of possible matchings between a candidate hypothesis and a training example this paper investigates the use of a stochastic bias to control this factor of complexity the exhaustive exploration of the matching space is replaced by considering a fixed number of matchings obtained by random sampling one thereby construct from positive and negative example a theory which is only approximately consistent both the degree of approximation and the computational cost of induction are controlled from the number of sample allowed this approach is illustrated and validated on the mutagenesis problem an ad hoc sampling mechanism ha been purposely designed and experimental result fully demonstrates the power of stochastic approximate induction in term of both predictive accuracy and computational cost furthermore this approach applies for learning both logic program a it is usually the case in ilp and constrained logic program extended logic program that can naturally handle numerical information the gain of learning constrained logic program for the mutagenesis problem is

text categorization generating role relationship automatically ellen riloff and jeffrey lorenzen department of computer science university of utah salt lake city ut friloff jlorenzg in natural language information retrieval forthcoming from kluwer academic publisher abstract in previous work we developed several algorithm that use extraction technique to achieve text the relevancy signature algorithm classifies text using extraction pattern and the augmented relevancy signature algorithm classifies text using extraction pattern and semantic feature associated with role filler riloff and lehnert these algorithm relied on training data including annotated text and a semantic dictionary in this chapter we describe two advance that significantly improve the practicality of our approach first we explain how the extraction pattern can be generated automatically using only preclassified text a input second we present the relevancy signature algorithm that us lexical item to represent role relationship instead of semantic feature using these technique we can automatically build text categorization that benefit from natural language processing natural language processing and information retrieval evolved a research area to a large extent the difference between them revolves around the amount of knowledge that is used natural language processing nlp technique rely on syntactic and semantic knowledge that is often manually encoded for a particular topic information retrieval ir technique typically use general method for processing large volume of text based on statistical word model these two paradigm reflect a between the benefit of domain knowledge and the cost and constraint associated with it our goal ha been to bridge this gap by developing method to acquire domain knowledge for nlp automatically our work focus on a natural language processing task called information extraction ie which aim to extract information from text recent advance in this area have made it possible to build ie system with minimal knowledge engineering for the last few year we have been using information technique to build text categorization system that benefit from natural language processing while requiring little or no manual knowledge engineering in previous work we demonstrated that information extraction could be used to achieve text categorization in some domain we used relevancy signature to classify text on the basis of extraction pattern and augmented relevancy to classify text using extraction pattern and semantic feature associated with role filler riloff and lehnert both of these performed better than a comparable algorithm in terrorism and joint venture domain riloff much of the domain knowledge needed for these algorithm could be acquired automatically but there were still significant bottleneck lurking underneath a manually annotated training corpus wa required to the extraction pattern and a dictionary of word tagged with semantic feature wa needed for the augmented relevancy signature in this article we describe two advance that significantly improve the practicality of our approach first we explain how the extraction pattern can be generated automatically using a system called without the need for an annotated training corpus second we present a variation of the augmented relevancy signature algorithm that doe not rely on feature the new version us only lexical item to represent role filler which are extracted automatically from the training corpus together with the relevancy signature represent specific role relationship that are generated automatically without any manual knowledge engineering in the first section we describe the extraction pattern used by our natural language processing system and describe two previous text based on these extraction pattern relevancy signature and augmented relevancy signature in the second section we discus our construction system that can generate extraction pattern automatically the only input to the system is a set of text associated with the domain in the third section we present the new relevancy signature representation and algorithm finally we present experiment comparing the different text on four categorization task related to terrorism in all case the signature representation performed better than individual word and the signature

information one of the hardest task for information system user is finding anything in the mess for a number of well documented reason including the amazing growth in the internet popularity and the drop in the cost of storage the amount of information on the net a well a on a user local computer ha increased dramatically in recent year although this readily available information should be extremely beneficial for computer user paradoxically it is now much harder to find anything many different solution have been proposed to the general information seeking task of user but few if any have addressed the need of individual or have leveraged the benefit of interaction the haystack project is an attempt to answer the need of the individual user creating such a system requires solving two problem half the problem address the manipulation of the data into a queryable format once the user information is represented in haystack the other half of the problem center around our desire to answer the highly varied question a user may ask about this information in this thesis we will propose a mean of representing information in a robust model within haystack and we will describe a

local prediction for plan recognition boris kerkez and michael cox department of computer science and engineering wright state university dayton oh bkerkez mcox abstract this paper present a novel plan recognition system that interprets observation of plan behavior using a case library of past observation the system is novel in that it represents a plan a a sequence of pair rather than a sequence of action preceded by some initial state and followed by some final goal state the system utilizes a unique abstraction scheme to represent index into the case base the paper examines and evaluates three different method for prediction the first method is prediction without adaptation the second is predication with adaptation and the third is prediction with heuristic we show that the first method is better than a baseline random prediction that the second method is an improvement over the first and that the second and the third method combined are the best overall strategy reference bares canamero delannoy kodratoff y xplans reasoning for plan recognition applied artificial intelligence bergmann wilke building and refining abstract planning case by change of representation language journal of artificial intelligence research bergmann wilke on the role of abstraction in reasoning in european conference on reasoning springer carbonell blythe etzioni gil joseph kahn knoblock minton perez reilly veloso wang x prodigy the manual and tutorial tech no carnegie mellon university department of computer science pittsburgh cox ram a introspective multistrategy learning on the construction of learning strategy artificial intelligence kautz a formal theory of plan recognition and it implementation in allen et reasoning about plan san francisco morgan kaufmann kerkez b incremental keyhole plan recognition technical report department of computer science and engineering wright state univ kerkez cox plan recognition using state index in aha watson ed reasoning research and development proceeding of international conference on reasoning pp berlin springer kerkez b learning plan library for plan recognition in proceeding of the midwest artificial intelligence and cognitive science conference iit chicago il lesh etzioni o scaling up goal recognition in proceeding of the fifth internat conference on principle of knowledge representation and reasoning pp pazzani learning causal pattern making a transition from to learning in michalski and tecuci machine learning iv a multistrategy approach morgan kaufmann san francisco veloso planning and learning by analogical reasoning berlin springer,1

hanover nh montague abstract given the ranked list of document returned by multiple search engine in response to a given query the problem of metasearch is to combine these list in a way which optimizes the performance of the combination this paper make three contribution to the problem of metasearch we describe and investigate a metasearch model based on an optimal democratic voting procedure the borda count we scribe and investigate a metasearch model based on bayesian inference and we describe and investigate a model for obtaining upper bound on the performance of metasearch

a case study of cbr david leake andrew kinley and david wilson computer science department lindley hall indiana university bloomington in leake akinley davwils abstract reasoning depends on multiple knowledge source beyond the case library including knowledge about case adaptation and criterion for similarity assessment because hand coding this knowledge account for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing cbr system it is appealing to acquire it by learning and cbr is a promising learning method to apply this observation suggests developing cbr system cbr system whose component themselves use cbr however despite early interest in approach to cbr this method ha received comparatively little attention open question include how component of a cbr system should be designed the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require and their effectiveness this paper investigates these question through a case study of issue addressed method used and result achieved by a planning system that us cbr to guide it case adaptation and similarity assessment the paper discus design consideration and present empirical result that support the usefulness of cbr that point

production tool for electronic arena event management and content production sabine hirtes michael hoch bernd lintermann and sally jane norman john bower hellstrm and malin carlzon abstract this document comprises a combined deliverable made up of deliverable and to the erena project this document considers how the production of event in electronic arena might be supported the concern is with the activity which are necessary in staging an event and how those activity might be best supported technically basing our research on the practical experience accumulating in erena and on the field study of production work performed we present novel technology and orientation to the support of production process these principally focus on technology for supporting event a they occur in and include proposal and demonstration of virtual camera for capturing activity in electronic arena technique for sonifying the activity of participant in an electronic arena to give an audible sense of the status of event a physical environment containing tangible interface to production software to facilitate timely direction and production work and a system for mapping data from participant to enable it flexible interpretation in environment it also begin to consider how content for event might be developed both a well a improvised in the document contains report of public artistic event which have driven the development here a well a stimulated novel collaboration throughout there is a concern to reflect critically on the status of the technology and concept explored where possible

a dynamic approach to reducing dialog in decision guide michelle doyle and pádraig cunningham department of computer science trinity college dublin dublin ireland abstract online decision guide typically ask too many question of the user a they make no attempt to focus the question we describe some approach to minimising the question asked of a user in an online query situation question are asked in an order that reflects their ability to narrow down the set of case thus time to reach an answer is decreased this ha the dual benefit of taking some of the monotony out of online query and also of decreasing the amount of network cycle most importantly question order is decided at run time and therefore adapts to the user this approach is in the spirit of lazy leaming with induction delayed to allowing adaptation to the emerging detail of the situation we evaluate a few different approach to the question selection task and compare the best approach one based on idea from retrieval in cbr to a commercial online decision guide reference aha bankert a comparative evaluation of sequential feature selection algorithm in proceeding of al statistic workshop bishop neural network for pattern recognition oxford university press oxford cunningham smyth b a comparison of and incremental approach to electronic fault diagnosis in proceeding of the based reasoning workshop cunningham carney j diversity versus quality in class fication ensemble based on feature selection to be presented at european conference on machine learning barcelona spain june dash liu yao j dimensionality reduction for unsupervised data in proceeding of ieee international conference on tool with ai pp dash liu handling large unsupervised data via dimensional ity reduction in proceeding of sigmod data mining and knowledge discovery workshop dmdk philadelphia usa may devaney ram a efficient feature selection in conceptual clustering in proceeding of the international conference on machine learning nashville doyle cunningham a dynamic approach to reducing dialog in decision guide extended version of this paper trinity college dublin computer science technical report http everitt cluster analysis edward arnold fast entropy the significance of the concept of entropy and it application in science and technology chapter the statistical significance of the entropy concept philip technical library eindhoven fisher knowledge acquisition via incremental conceptual clustering in machine learning vol kaufman rousseeuw finding group in data an introduction to cluster analysis wiley new york quinlan program for machine learning morgan kaufmann smyth cunningham a comparison of incremental reasoning and inductive learning in proceeding of the european workshop on reasoning chantilly france november,1
on the power of nonlinear amos beimel dept of computer science university israel beimel yuval ishai dimacs and at t lab research frelinghuysen road piscataway nj usa yuval abstract a scheme enables a dealer to distribute a secret among n party such that only some predefined set of party will be able to reconstruct the secret from their share the monotone collection of authorized set is called an access structure and is freely identified with it characteristic monotone function f n a family of scheme is called efficient if the total length of the n share is polynomial in most known scheme belonged to a class of linear scheme whose complexity coincides with the span program size of their access structure prior to this work there wa no evidence that nonlinear scheme can be significantly more efficient than linear scheme and in particular there were no candidate for scheme efficiently realizing access structure which do not lie in nc the main contribution of this work is the construction of two efficient nonlinear scheme a scheme with privacy whose access structure is conjectured not to lie in nc a scheme with statistical privacy whose structure is conjectured not to lie in another contribution is the study of a class of nonlinear scheme termed scheme obtained by composing scheme over different field we show that while these scheme are possibly more powerful than

uncertainty of inference in ir the strict formalism of probability theory often confines our use of knowledge to statistical knowledge alone connection between term based on their knowledge manual thesaurus can only be incorporated with difficulty in this paper departing from a general idea proposed by van rijsbergen we first develop an inferential approach within a fuzzy modal logic framework differing from previous approach the logical component is emphasized and considered a the pillar in our approach in addition the flexibility of a fuzzy modal logic framework offer the possibility of

using clustering strategy for creating authority file james french allison powell department of computer science university of virginia charlottesville virginia ffrench eric schulman institute for defense analysis beauregard street alexandria va eschulma january abstract a more online database are integrated into digital library the issue of quality control of the data becomes increasingly important especially a it relates to the effective retrieval of information authority work the need to discover and reconcile variant form of string in bibliographic entry will become more critical in the future spelling variant misspelling and transliteration difference will all increase the difficulty of retrieving information we investigate a number of approximate string matching technique that have traditionally been used to help with this problem we then introduce the notion of approximate word matching and show how it can be used to improve detection and categorization of variant form we demonstrate the utility of these approach using data from the astrophysics data system and show how we can reduce the human effort involved in the creation of authority file reference abt abt a

road bldg mesa az robgray abstract we have been developing a haptic back display using a tactor array this paper report two study that investigated the use of such a display for delivering and information to it user the first study measured the effectiveness of haptic cue in redirecting an visual spatial attention the observer wa first tapped on the back and then asked to detect a change between two similar visual scene we found that reaction time decreased by an average of m when the location of the tactor coincided with the quadrant of the visual scene where a change occurred we also found that reaction time increased by an average of m when the location of the tapping and visual change did not coincide such a haptic attentional cueing system can be beneficial to a user who must attend to information in small area within a large and complex visual display an aircraft cockpit in the second study sequenced pulse were employed to impart directional information we found that

information extraction a a stepping stone toward story understanding ellen riloff department of computer science university of utah salt lake city ut riloff historically story understanding system have depended on a great deal of natural language understanding system that use conceptual knowledge structure typically rely on enormous amount of manual knowledge engineering while much of the work on conceptual knowledge structure ha been hailed a research in cognitive modeling and narrative understanding from a practical perspective it ha also been viewed with skepticism because of the underlying knowledge engineering the thought of building a conceptual natural language processing nlp system that can understand text is daunting even to the most ardent enthusiast so must we grit our collective teeth and assume that story understanding will be limited to prototype system in the foreseeable future or will conceptual natural language processing ultimately depend on a massive manual knowledge engineering effort such a cyc perhaps the answer lie in the current trend of information extraction research information extraction ie is a form of natural language processing in which certain type of information must be recognized and extracted from text although ie system are typically designed for a single there is a great deal of interest in building system that are easily portable to new domain many researcher are developing method to acquire the necessary knowledge automatically the goal is not necessarily to produce a information extraction system but to create tool that would allow user to build customized information extraction quickly if the ie researcher are ultimately successful we could imagine being able to create quite literally an ie system du jour that is tailored to our interest on any given day another possible future scenario is to assemble a large suite of ie system each being a specialist in extracting information pertaining to it own area of expertise collectively the suite of system could support conceptual natural language understanding capability if not for every subject then at least for a wide variety of subject on the surface information extraction might appear to be fundamentally different from story understanding and there are some important difference between these task but we will argue that the challenge and difficulty underlying them are largely the same a corollary of this view is that automated knowledge acquisition technique developed for information extraction are likely to be applicable to story understanding a well in this chapter we will explain how research in information extraction may be a significant stepping stone toward progress in story understanding we will discus emerging trend in the information extraction community draw parallel between the two type of natural language understanding and describe recent research in automated case frame generation for information extraction

linguistic annotation for the semantic web paul buitelaar and thierry declerck dfki gmbh language technology department stuhlsatzenhausweg saarbruecken germany abstract establishing the semantic web on a large scale implies the widespread notation of web document with knowledge markup for this purpose tool have been developed that allow for annotation of web document with metadata however given that a large number of web document consist either fully or at least partially of free text language technology tool will be needed to support this authoring process by providing an automatic analysis of the semantic structure of textual document in this way free text document will become available a document from which meaningful unit can be extracted automatically information extraction and organized through clustering or text mining obviously this is of importance for both knowledge markup and ontology development the dynamic adaptation of ontology to evolving and domain in this paper

merge strategy for multiple case plan replay manuela veloso computer science department carnegie mellon university pittsburgh pa mmv http abstract planning by analogical reasoning is a learning method that consists of the storage retrieval and replay of planning episode planning performance improves with the accumulation and reuse of a library of planning case retrieval is driven by similarity metric based on planning goal and scenario in complex situation with multiple goal retrieval may find multiple past planning case that are jointly similar to the new planning situation this paper present the issue and implication involved in the replay of multiple planning case a opposed to a single one multiple case plan replay involves the adaptation and merging of the annotated derivation of the planning case several merge strategy for replay are introduced that can process with various form of eagerness the difference between the past and new situation and the annotated justification at the planning case in particular we introduce an effective merging strategy that considers plan step choice especially appropriate for the interleaving of planning and plan execution we illustrate and discus the effectiveness of the merging strategy in specific domain reference alexander and tsatsoulis perry alexander and costa tsatsoulis using for skeletal planning and partial case reuse

musical genre classification of audio signal george tzanetakis student member ieee and perry cook member ieee abstract genre are categorical label created by to characterize piece of music a musical genre is by the common characteristic shared by it member these characteristic typically are related to the instrumentation rhythmic structure and harmonic content of the music genre are commonly used to structure the large collection of music available on the web currently musical genre annotation is performed manually automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval system in automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating feature for any type of analysis of musical signal in this paper the automatic classification of audio signal into an hierarchy of musical genre is explored more specifically three feature set for representing timbral texture rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed the performance and relative importance of the proposed feature is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifier using audio collection both whole file and classification scheme are described using the proposed feature set classification of for ten musical genre is achieved this result is comparable to result reported

inductive logic programming for natural language processing raymond mooney department of computer sdences university of texas austin tx usa abstract this paper review our recent work on applying inductive logic programming to the construction of natural language processing system we have developed a system chill that learns a parser from a training corpus of parsed sentence by inducing heuristic that control an initial parser chill learns syntactic parser a well a one that translate english database query directly into executable logical form the atis corpus of airline information query wa used to test the acquisition of syntactic parser and chill performed competitively with recent statistical method english query to a small database on geography were used to test the acquisition of a complete natural language interface and the parser that chill acquired wa more accurate than an existing system the paper also includes a discussion of several issue this work ha raised regarding the capability and testing of ilp system a well a a summary of our current research direction reference abramson dahl logic grammar new york allen natural language understanding menlo
